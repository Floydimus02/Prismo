Lunar Monochrome
================

​Inspired by the stark clarity of lunar landscapes, Lunar Monochrome is a minimalist, high-contrast personal branding page designed for technologists and leaders who prioritise digital sovereignty, simplicity, and the old-school aesthetic of the early web, rejecting modern web bloat—function over form.

​Function
---------

*   ​**Performance First:** Near-instant load times with zero external dependencies.
    
*   ​**Privacy Hardened:** Restrictive robots.txt and noindex meta tags prevent automated search engine indexing.
    
*   ​**Technical Security:** Zero frameworks or external tracking scripts reduce the digital attack surface.
    

​Form
-----

*   ​**Mobile Responsiveness:** Fluid layout ensures legibility across all device classes.
    
*   ​**Mature Visuals:** Sophisticated paper-white and monospace palette signalling professional rigour.
